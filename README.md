**Communication Without Memory**  
*Messages pass through. Nothing stays. Not by policy—by design.*

## 🛡️ What is Warden?

Warden is a privacy-first communication protocol built on a revolutionary principle: **memoryless architecture**. Unlike other encrypted messaging services that store metadata or can be forced to comply with surveillance, Warden is mathematically incapable of surveillance.

### Core Principle
> "If no data exists, no data can be seized."

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. RAM-Only Architecture
- Messages exist **solely in volatile memory**
- No disk writing, no persistence
- Power loss = complete data annihilation

### 2. Mathematically Blind Servers
- Servers route encrypted messages but **cannot read them**
- Even with a court order, we have **nothing to provide**
- Not "we won't" but "we cannot"

### 3. Jurisdictional Nomadism
- Servers automatically migrate between legal jurisdictions
- If pressured in one location, the service appears elsewhere
- Always one step ahead of compliance requests

### 4. Zero Metadata
- No contact lists
- No timestamps
- No connection logs
- **Nothing** to subpoena

## 🚀 Current Status

### Phase 1: Website & Community ✅
- [x] Landing page at [warden.sx](https://warden.sx)
- [x] Transparency dashboard
- [x] Waitlist system
- [x] Public documentation

### Phase 2: Messenger Protocol (In Development)
- Pure P2P where possible
- Messages pass through servers that immediately forget everything. No logs, no storage, nothing to seize.
- Future-proof encryption that even tomorrow's supercomputers can't break.

### Phase 3: VPN Service (Planned)
- RAM-only logging VPN
- Jurisdiction-hopping infrastructure
- Open-source clients
